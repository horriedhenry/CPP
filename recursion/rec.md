# Function
```text
when a function finishes exceuting it is removed from the stack and 
the **flow of program is restored to where that function was called.**
```

# Recurrence Relation
```text
when you wrtie recursion in a formula it is called recurrence relation
```

# Solve Recursion Problems
- write recurrence relation first and write the code.
- Draw recursion tree.
- about the tree.
    1. See the flow of function, how they are getting in stack.
    2. Identify and focus on left tree calls and right tree calls.
    3. Draw the tree and pointers(arrows -> flow of returning values)
    4. Use a debugger to see how the flow of function calls
    5. See how the values & what type of values are getting returned at each step (recursion tree) and see where the function call will come out.

# Variables In Recursion

```text
1. Arguments
2. return type
3. body of function(Variables in body of function)
```
