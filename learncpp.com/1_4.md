# Variable assignment and initialization

```c++
// var_type var_name = value;
int var = 1;
```

### Initialization

- One downside of assignment is that it requires at least two statements: one to define the variable, and another to assign the value.
- These two steps can be combined. When an object is defined, you can optionally give it an initial value. The process of specifying an initial value for an object is called initialization, and the syntax used to initialize an object is called an initializer.

### Different forms of initialization

```c++
int age { 21 }; // define var age and initialize with 21
```

there are 6 basic ways to initialize variables in C++:

```c++
int a;         // no initializer (default initialization)
int b = 5;     // initial value after equals sign (copy initialization)
int c( 6 );    // initial value in parenthesis (direct initialization) requires a value int c(); does not work (it is interpreted as a function otherwise)

// List initialization methods (C++11) (preferred)
int d { 7 };   // initial value in braces (direct list initialization)
int e = { 8 }; // initial value in braces after equals sign (copy list initialization)
int f {};      // initializer is empty braces (value initialization)
```

#### Observation

```c++
int a{};
cout << a;
```
this prints `0`
but...

```c++
int a;
cout << a;
```
but this prints some garbage integer value (in my case : 32764)

- so `value initialization` i.e `int any_var {}` sets a default value `0`.


### Copy Initialization

```c++
int var = 5;
```

### Note

Copy initialization is also used whenever values are implicitly copied or converted, such as when passing arguments to a function by value, returning from a function by value, or catching exceptions by value.

### The reason why list initialization is recommended

```c++
// prefer list initialization (reason)

float float_number = 1.222;
int int_number = float_number; // this does not throw any error, it just converts float to int
// the developer might not want this, should throw an error to indicate that one is doing type conversion

std::cout << "float number : " << float_number << endl;
std::cout << "int number : " << int_number << endl;

// but
float float_nbr{1.22};
// this throws an error
// int int_nbr{float_nbr}; // float cannot be narrowed to int in initilazer list
// solve this by using type conversion to int
int int_nbr{int(float_nbr)}; // when some dev does this he know that he is doing type conversion.
```

### Author's Note

> Bjarne Stroustrup (creator of C++) and Herb Sutter (C++ expert) also recommend using list initialization to initialize your variables.

>In modern C++, there are some cases where list initialization does not work as expected. We cover one such case in lesson 16.2 -- Introduction to std::vector and list constructors.

>Because of such quirks, some experienced developers now advocate for using a mix of copy, direct, and list initialization, depending on the circumstance. Once you are familiar enough with the language to understand the nuances of each initialization type and the reasoning behind such recommendations, you can evaluate on your own whether you find these arguments persuasive.

### Best Practices

- Initialize your variables upon creation.


### The [[maybe_unused]] attribute (c++17)

```c++
int main()
{
    double pi { 3.14159 };
    double gravity { 9.8 };
    double phi { 1.61803 };

    // assume some of the above are used here, some are not

    return 0;
}
```

```c++
int main()
{
    [[maybe_unused]] double pi { 3.14159 };
    [[maybe_unused]] double gravity { 9.8 };
    [[maybe_unused]] double phi { 1.61803 };

    // the above variables will not generate unused variable warnings

    return 0;
}
```

The compliler will not generate any warnings/error on variables being unused.
