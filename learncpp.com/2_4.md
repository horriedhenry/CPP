### Unreferenced parameters

In certain cases, you will encounter functions that have parameters that are not used in the body of the function. These are called **unreferenced parameters**.

This can happen when a function parameter was once used, but is not used any longer. Also called as unused function parameters.

```c++
#include <iostream>

void doSomething(int count) // warning: unreferenced parameter count
{
    // This function used to do something with count but it is not used any longer
}

int main()
{
    doSomething(4);
    return 0;
}
```

**NOTE :** If the unused function parameter were simply removed, then any existing call to the function would break (because the function call would be supplying more arguments than the function could accept).


In a function definition, the name of a function parameter is optional. Therefore, in cases where a function parameter needs to exist but is not used in the body of the function, you can simply omit the name. A parameter without a name is called an unnamed parameter:

```c++
void doSomething(int) // ok: unnamed parameter will not generate warning
{
}
```

The Google C++ style guide recommends using a comment to document what the unnamed parameter was:

```c++
void doSomething(int /*count*/)
{
}
```

### Conclusion

Function parameters and return values are the key mechanisms by which functions can be written in a reusable way, as it allows us to write functions that can perform tasks and return retrieved or calculated results back to the caller without knowing what the specific inputs or outputs are ahead of time.
