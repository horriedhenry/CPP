[2.3 — Void functions (non-value returning functions)](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/void-functions-non-value-returning-functions/)

### Void functions can’t be used in expression that require a value

Some types of expressions require values. For example:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << 5; // ok: 5 is a literal value that we're sending to the console to be printed
    std::cout << ;  // compile error: no value provided

    return 0;
}
```

In the above program, the value to be printed needs to be provided on the right-side of the **std::cout <<**. If no value is provided, the compiler will produce a syntax error. Since the second call to **std::cout** does not provide a value to be printed, this causes an error.

Similarly...

```c++
#include <iostream>

// void means the function does not return a value to the caller
void printHi()
{
    std::cout << "Hi" << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    printHi(); // okay: function printHi() is called, no value is returned

    std::cout << printHi(); // compile error
    // cout requires a value to send to the console

    return 0;
}
```

throws : `clang: Invalid operands to binary expression ('ostream' (aka 'basic_ostream<char>') and 'void') [typecheck_invalid_operands]`

The first call to **printHi()** is called in a context that does not require a value. Since the function doesn’t return a value, this is fine.

The second function call to function **printHi()** won’t even compile. Function printHi has a void return type, meaning it doesn’t return a value. However, this statement is trying to send the return value of printHi to **std::cout** to be printed. **std::cout** doesn’t know how to handle this (what value would it output?). Consequently, the compiler will flag this as an error. You’ll need to comment out this line of code in order to make your code compile.


### Tip
Some statements require values to be provided, and others don’t.

When we have a statement that consists of just a function call (e.g. the first printHi() in the above example), we’re calling a function for its behavior, not its return value. In this case, we can call either a non-value returning function, or we can call a value-returning function and just ignore the return value.

When we call a function in a context that requires a value (e.g. std::cout), a value must be provided. In such a context, we can only call value-returning functions.

```c++
#include <iostream>

// Function that does not return a value
void returnNothing()
{
}

// Function that returns a value
int returnFive()
{
    return 5;
}

int main()
{
    // When calling a function by itself, no value is required
    returnNothing(); // ok: we can call a function that does not return a value
    returnFive();    // ok: we can call a function that returns a value, and ignore that return value

    // When calling a function in a context that requires a value (like std::cout)
    std::cout << returnFive();    // ok: we can call a function that returns a value, and the value will be used
    std::cout << returnNothing(); // compile error: we can't call a function that returns void in this context

    return 0;
}
```
