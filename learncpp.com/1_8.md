[1.8 â€” Whitespace and basic formatting](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/whitespace-and-basic-formatting/)

### Quoted text takes the amount of whitespace literally

Quoted text separated by nothing but whitespace (spaces, tabs, or newlines) will be concatenated:

Inside quoted text, the amount of whitespace is taken literally.

```c++
std::cout << "Hello world!"; // 12 characters
```

is different than:

```c++
std::cout << "Hello          world!"; // 21 characters
```

Newlines are not allowed in quoted text:

```c++
std::cout << "Hello "
"World! " << std::endl; // Prints Hello World!                                  

std::cout << "Hello
     world!"; // Not allowed!

```

Lines should not be too long. Typically, 80 characters has been the de facto standard for the maximum length a line should be. If a line is going to be longer, it should be split (at a reasonable spot) into multiple lines. This can be done by indenting each subsequent line with an extra tab, or if the lines are similar, by aligning it with the line above (whichever is easier to read).
