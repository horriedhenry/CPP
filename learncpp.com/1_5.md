# std::cout is Buffered

```c++
std::cout << "print this to the console";
```

If the program encounters this statement instead of immedietly printing it to the standard out or console the program will copy it to buffer; a region in memory where set aside to collect such requests. Periodically the **buffer** gets **flushed** meaning all the data collected in the buffer will be sent to it's destination (in this case to the console).

### std::endl flushes the buffer and '\n' prints buffer.

when ever the program encounters **std::endl** it will send all the contents in the buffer to the console and **flushes** the buffer that is just remove the stored contents in the buffer. where as `\n` will just print the entire buffer contents before the **new line** character.

### Example

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <chrono>
#include <thread>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "This will stay in the buffer ";
    // any thing in between these two print statements will be executed without any issues
    int a{1}, b{2};
    int c {a + b};
    // the above code executes without any issues
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(5));
    std::cout << "Until a newline or flush is encountered." << std::endl;
}
```

You may think that this statement **This will stay in the buffer** will be sent to the **standard out** or console and then it will wait for **5** seconds to print the next statement.. but that is not the case here.

What happens is that the first print statement is copied to the buffer as there is not **\n** character nothing will be sent to the console, it will just stay in the buffer. And it will wait for **5** seconds and then as the program encounters another print statement it will copy that statement into the buffer but not there is an **std::endl** now the program will print the entire buffer and then flushes the buffer.

This is an overview..

1. encountered cout      : "This will stay in the buffer" -> copy this to buffer.
2. wait for **5**seconds
3. encountered cout      : "Until a newline or flush is encountered." -> copy this to buffer.
4. encountered std::endl : print the buffer contents and flushes / clear the buffer.
5. Finally after **5** seconds this will be printed to the standard out.

standard out : This will stay in the buffer Until a newline or flush is encountered.

### Key insight

The opposite of buffered output is unbuffered output. With unbuffered output, each individual output request is sent directly to the output device.

Writing data to a buffer is typically fast, whereas transferring a batch of data to an output device is comparatively slow. Buffering can significantly increase performance by minimizing the number of slow transfers that need to be performed when there are multiple output requests.

### Extraction & Insertion Operator

This **<<** is Insertion Operator and this **>>** is Extraction Operator. **std::cout** uses **<<** to insert contents into buffer, and **std::cout** uses **>>** operator to extract input given by user from console.
