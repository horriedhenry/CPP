[1.6 â€” Uninitialized variables and undefined behavior](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/uninitialized-variables-and-undefined-behavior/)

In languages like c/c++ when a variable is declared but is not initialized with any value, by default the language does not give that variable a default value (say zero).

```c++
int x; // if you try to print this to standard out you will either get a garbage value or an error.
```

Obviously this is not the case for list initialization, but it's not about that.

```c++
int x{}; // zero will be the default value
```

When debugging dealing with uninitialized variables can be painful....

General rule : Avoid uninitialized variables.

### Implementation-defined behavior and unspecified behavior

**Implementation-defined behavior** means the behavior of some syntax is left up to the implementation (the compiler) to define. Such behaviors must be consistent and documented, but different compilers may produce different results. Example **sizeof(int)** will produce **4** on many computers but on some it might be **2**. These things depenend on the implementation.

**Unspecified behavior** is almost identical to implementation-defined behavior in that the behavior is left up to the implementation, but the implementation is not required to document the behavior.

**Note** : We generally want to avoid implementation-defined and unspecified behavior, as it means our program may not work as expected if compiled on a different compiler (or even on the same compiler if we change project settings that affect how the implementation behaves!)
