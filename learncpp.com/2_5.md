[2.5 â€” Introduction to local scope](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-local-scope/)

### Local Variables

Variables defined inside the body of a function are called **local variables**. Function parameters are also local variables to that function.

Life time of a variable is run time property and scope of a variable is compile time property.

Scope of a variable start from the point of it's creation till the end of the current function, or till the current function is done executing.

Example for the scope of variable `x`.

```c++
#include <iostream>

// x is not in scope anywhere in this function
void doSomething()
{
    std::cout << "Hello!\n";
}

int main()
{
    // x can not be used here because it's not in scope yet

    int x{ 0 }; // x enters scope here and can now be used within this function

    doSomething();

    return 0;
} // x goes out of scope here and can no longer be used, and is destroyed
```

- variable `x` is local to `main()`, but is not local to `doSomething()`.

- Define local variables as close to their first use as reasonable.
