[1.9 — Introduction to literals and operators](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-literals-and-operators/)

### Literals

Example

```c++
std::cout << "Hello world!";
int x { 5 };
```

A **literal** (also known as **literal constant**) is a fixed value that has been inserted directly into the source code.

#### Example

```c++
std::cout << 5 << "\n"; // 5 is a literal
```

```c++
int x { 5 };
std::cout << x << "\n";
```

Here 5 is a literal that will be copied to a memory location by the compiler so when ever we need 5 we access it through the variable **x** that is what we did with the **cout** statement.

### Key insight

Literals are values that are inserted directly into the source code. These values usually appear directly in the executable code (unless they are optimized out).

Objects and variables represent memory locations that hold values. These values can be fetched on demand.

## Operators (copy pasta)

The number of operands that an operator takes as input is called the operator’s **arity**. Operators in C++ come in four different **arities**.

1. **Unary** operators act on one operand. An example of a unary operator is the `-` operator. For example, given `-5`,  `operator-` takes literal operand `5` and flips its sign to produce new output value `-5`.

2. **Binary** operators act on two operands (often called left and right, as the left operand appears on the left side of the operator, and the right operand appears on the right side of the operator). An example of a binary operator is the + operator. For example, given **3 + 4** , **operator+** takes the left operand **3** and the right operand **4** and applies mathematical addition to produce new output value **7**. The insertion (**<<**) and extraction (**>>**) operators are binary operators, taking **std::cout** or **std::cin** on the left side, and the value to output or variable to input to on the right side.

### std::cout & **<<** operator (Bard)

**1. std::cout - The Output Stream, Not the Console :**

- `std::cout` is an object of the `ostream` class in C++. It represents the standard output stream, which is a **connection** to the destination where your program's output goes.
- This destination is typically the console or terminal, but it can be redirected to a file or another output device depending on how the program is run.

**2. Insertion Operator (<<) - Sending Data :**

- The `<<` operator is overloaded for streams like `std::cout`. When used with `std::cout`, it becomes the insertion operator.
- It doesn't strictly take operands like a typical binary operator. Instead, it takes the value on its **right** side (e.g., `"some text"`) and **inserts** it into the output stream on its **left** (`std::cout`).

**3. Sending to Console :**

- Ultimately, the data inserted into `std::cout` gets sent to the console or terminal because it's the default destination for the standard output stream.

**In essence :**

- `std::cout` acts as a bridge between your program and the output destination.
- The `<<` operator helps you send data (like strings, numbers, etc.) across this bridge to be displayed on the console (or redirected output).

### Buffering in std::cout (Bard)

You're partially right! `std::cout` does use a buffer, but its job is a bit more nuanced than just sending the buffer directly to the console. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Buffering in `std::cout` :**

- `std::cout` has an internal buffer that temporarily stores data before it's sent to the console. This helps improve performance by:
    - Reducing the number of calls to the console, which can be slow.
    - Grouping multiple small outputs into a single larger chunk for efficiency.

**2. Flushing the Buffer :**

- The data doesn't stay in the buffer indefinitely. It's eventually "flushed" out to the console. This can happen:
    - When the buffer reaches a certain size (determined by the implementation).
    - When you use the `std::endl` manipulator (which inserts a newline and flushes the buffer).
    - Explicitly by calling the `std::cout.flush()` function.

**3. `std::cout`'s Job :**

- `std::cout`'s primary job is to provide a convenient way to send formatted output to the standard output stream.
- It uses the insertion operator (`<<`) to take various data types (strings, numbers, etc.) and format them appropriately before sending them to the buffer.
- The buffer acts as a temporary holding area to optimize the output process.

**4. Console vs. Actual Destination :**

- While the console is the typical destination for `std::cout`, it's important to remember that the standard output stream can be redirected to a file or another output device.
- `std::cout` doesn't directly control the console itself. It sends data to the operating system, which then routes it to the appropriate destination (console in this case).

**Here's an analogy :**

Imagine `std::cout` as a post office. You (the program) write messages (data) and give them to the post office (`std::cout`). The post office has a mailbox (buffer) where it temporarily holds the messages. When the mailbox is full or it's time for mail delivery, the post office sends the messages (flushing the buffer) to the recipient (console or redirected destination).


3. **Ternary** operators act on three operands. There is only one of these in C++ (the conditional operator).

```c++
// condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false;

int age = 20;
bool isAdult = (age >= 18) ? true : false;

std::string message = (isAdult) ? "You are an adult." : "You are not an adult.";
std::cout << message << std::endl;
```

4. **Nullary** operators act on zero operands. There is also only one of these in C++ (the throw operator).

### Chaining operators

Operators can be chained together such that the output of one operator can be used as the input for another operator. For example, given the following: **2 * 3 + 4**, the multiplication operator goes first, and converts left operand **2** and right operand **3** into return value **6** (which becomes the left operand for the plus operator). Next, the plus operator executes, and converts left operand **6** and right operand **4** into new value **10**.

The arithmetic operators execute in the same order as they do in standard mathematics: Parenthesis first, then Exponents, then Multiplication & Division, then Addition & Subtraction. This ordering is sometimes abbreviated **PEMDAS**.

## Return values and side effects

**Return Values**

- In C++, functions can optionally provide a single return value to communicate the result of their calculations or operations.
- This value is typically used in the expression where the function is called.
- Example:

```c++
int add(int x, int y) {
  return x + y; // Return value is the sum of x and y
}

int result = add(5, 3); // result will hold the value 8 (5 + 3)
```

**Side Effects**

- Side effects refer to any observable change to the program state beyond simply providing a return value.
- This can involve:
    - Modifying variables
    - Performing input/output operations (printing to the console, reading from a file)
    - Calling other functions that have side effects
- Side effects are often used to achieve specific actions within a program.
- Example:

```c++
void printNumber(int num) {
  std::cout << num << std::endl; // Side effect: prints the value of num
}

printNumber(10); // This line has no return value, but it prints 10 to the console
```

**Key Points**

- **Focus:**
    - Return values focus on providing a calculated result.
    - Side effects focus on modifying the program state or performing actions.
- **Observability:**
    - Both return values and side effects are observable, but in different ways.
        - Return values are directly assigned or used in expressions.
        - Side effects are observed by their impact on the program state (e.g., printed output, changed variable values).
- **Purpose:**
    - Return values are used to communicate results for further processing or decision-making.
    - Side effects are used to perform actions or modify the program state.

**Nomenclature**

- The term "side effect" has different meanings in everyday language and C++.
    - In everyday language, it often refers to unwanted or unexpected consequences.
    - In C++, it refers to any observable effect beyond the return value.
- Not all side effects are negative or unexpected. In fact, many functions are designed specifically for their side effects.

**Best Practices**

- While side effects can be powerful, using them excessively can make code harder to understand and reason about.
- Here are some tips for writing clear and maintainable code:
    - Use functions with clear return values when appropriate.
    - If a function has significant side effects, document them clearly in the code comments.
    - Consider using techniques like functional programming when dealing with complex logic to minimize side effects.


- Most operators in C++ just use their operands to calculate a return value. For example, **-5** produces return value **-5** and **2 + 3** produces return value **5**. There are a few operators that do not produce return values (such as delete and throw).

- Some operators have additional behaviors. An operator (or function, explained above) that has some observable effect beyond producing a return value is said to have a **side effect**. For example, when **x = 5** is evaluated, the assignment operator has the side effect of assigning the value **5** to variable **x**. The changed value of **x** is observable (e.g. by printing the value of x) even after the operator has finished executing.

### Explanation (Bard)

The example breaks down the concept of side effects in C++ using two cases: variable assignment and console output. Let's break it down further:

**1. Assignment operator (x = 5):**

- Here, `x = 5` is an expression that involves the assignment operator (`=`).
- This operator has two parts:
    - **The right operand (value on the right):** In this case, it's `5`.
    - **The left operand (variable on the left):** It's `x`.
- **Side effect:** The assignment operator's side effect is that it **modifies the value of the variable on the left** (in this case, `x`). It takes the value on the right (`5`) and stores it in the memory location associated with the variable `x`.
- **Return value:** The assignment operator itself actually **doesn't have a return value**. Its purpose is to perform the modification.
- **Observing the change:** You can observe the change in `x` by printing its value later in your code. For example, `std::cout << x << std::endl;` would print `5` to the console because `x` now holds that value.

*2. Console output (std::cout << 5):**

- `std::cout << 5` is another expression that uses the output stream object (`std::cout`).
- **Side effect:** The side effect of this expression is that it **sends the value `5` to the console** (usually your terminal window). This modifies the state of the console by displaying the number.
- **Return value:** Similar to the assignment operator, this expression also **doesn't have a return value**. Its purpose is to perform the output.
- **Observing the effect:** You can directly observe the output on the console. You'll see the number `5` printed.

**Key takeaway:**

In both cases, the focus is on what happens beyond just providing a return value. The assignment operator modifies a variable, and the console output modifies the console's state by displaying information. These are the side effects.

- std::cout << 5 has the side effect of printing 5 to the console. We can observe the fact that 5 has been printed to the console even after std::cout << 5 has finished executing.

### Explanation (Bard)

1. **`std::cout`**: This is an object in C++ used for sending output to the console (usually your terminal window).
2. **`<<`**: This is the insertion operator. It's used to "put" something (in this case, the value `5`) into the output stream (`std::cout`).
3. **`5`**: This is the literal value we want to send to the console (the number five).
4. **Side effect**: The entire expression `std::cout << 5` has a side effect. Here, the side effect is that the value `5` gets **printed to the console**. This is the observable change it produces.
5. **Finished executing**: Once the expression `std::cout << 5` is evaluated, it's done with its job. It has inserted the value `5` into the output stream.
6. **Observing the output**: Even though `std::cout << 5` has finished executing, the side effect (printing `5`) is still visible. You'll see the number `5` displayed on the console because that's what was sent there.

Here's an analogy: Imagine you have a box (console) and a note (the value `5`). The expression `std::cout << 5` is like putting the note (the value `5`) into the box (console). Once you've put the note in (finished executing), the note remains in the box (the output is still visible).

Remember, the focus is on the observable change (`5` appearing on the console) that happens even after the expression itself is finished.

### Nomenclature

In C++, the term “side effect” has a different meaning: it is an observable effect of an operator or function beyond producing a return value. We use certain operators (e.g. the assignment operator) primarily for their side effects. In such cases, the side effect is both beneficial and predictable (and it is the return value that is often incidental).

## For Advanced Readers

For the operators that we call primarily for their return values (e.g. **operator+** or **operator* **), it’s usually obvious what their return values will be (e.g. the sum or product of the operands).

For the operators we call primarily for their side effects (e.g. **operator=** or **operator<<**), it’s not always obvious what return values they produce (if any). For example, what return value would you expect **x = 5** to have?

Both **operator=** and **operator<<** (when used to output values to the console) return their left operand. Thus, **x = 5** returns **x**, and **std::cout << 5** returns **std::cout**. This is done so that these operators can be chained.

For example, **x = y = 5** evaluates as . **x = (y = 5)** First **y = 5** assigns **5** to **y**. This operation then returns **y**, which can then be assigned to **x**.

**std::cout << "Hello " << "world"** evaluates as **(std::cout << "Hello ") << "world!"**. This first prints **"Hello "** to the console. This operation returns **std::cout**, which can then be used to print **"world!"** to the console as well.

### Explanation (Bard), Analogy

**Understanding Operator Return Values**

In programming languages like C++, operators can be overloaded, meaning they can be given custom behavior for user-defined data types. Here, we'll focus on two common operators:

- `operator=` (assignment operator): Used to assign a value to a variable.
- `operator<<` (insertion operator): Often used for outputting values to streams like the console.

**Return Values for Side-Effect Operators**

Unlike operators primarily used for calculations (like `+` or `*`), `operator=` and `operator<<` are primarily used for their side effects, such as modifying a variable or sending data to a stream. However, they still return a value, and this return value plays a crucial role in enabling chaining of these operators.

**Chaining: The Reason Behind the Return Value**

Chaining refers to using multiple operators sequentially on the same line. Here's why the return value of `operator=` and `operator<<` is important for chaining:

1. **Assignment Chaining:**
   ```c++
   x = y = 5;
   ```
   - This statement is equivalent to `x = (y = 5)`.
   - First, `y = 5` assigns 5 to `y`.
   - Crucially, `operator=` on `y` returns `y` (itself), allowing the result (`y`) to be assigned to `x` in the next step.

2. **Output Stream Chaining:**
   ```c++
   std::cout << "Hello " << "world!" << std::endl;
   ```
   - This statement prints "Hello world!" to the console.
   - `operator<<` on `std::cout` (for the first string) returns `std::cout` itself.
   - This allows further insertions (`"world!"` and `std::endl`) to be chained on the same stream (`std::cout`).

**Return Value Summary**

- `operator=`  : Returns a reference to the left operand (`x` in `x = 5`). This allows chaining assignments.
- `operator<<` : (output stream): Returns a reference to the output stream object (`std::cout` in `std::cout << "Hello"`). This allows chaining further output operations.

**Key Points**

- The return value of these operators is not typically used directly for calculations but enables chaining.
- The return value serves as a placeholder, allowing the result of one operation to be used in the next step of the chain.

### std::cout << "Hello " << "World!";

Imagine you have a conveyor belt at a factory. Items come down the belt, you do something with them (like painting them), and then they move on to the next station.

- **The conveyor belt:** This represents the `std::cout` object. It's a stream that carries things to be printed to the console (like your screen).
- **The items:** These are the strings "Hello " and "world".
- **The painting station:** This represents the `operator<<` (insertion operator). It takes something and "inserts" it onto the conveyor belt (stream).

Here's what happens in your code:

1. You put "Hello " onto the conveyor belt using `std::cout << "Hello "`.
2. **BUT**, `operator<<` doesn't just send "Hello " and disappear. It's like a helpful worker who **holds onto the conveyor belt** (returns `std::cout`) so you can keep using it.
3. Now, you can put "world" onto the same conveyor belt using `<< "world!"`. The worker (the return value of `operator<<`) lets you use the same conveyor belt (`std::cout`) again.
4. Finally, everything on the conveyor belt (both "Hello " and "world!") gets printed to the console.

**Why is this helpful?**

- You can chain multiple things to print on the same line without having to write `std::cout` every time.
- It's like a shortcut: `std::cout << "Hello " << "world!"` is easier to write than `std::cout << "Hello "; std::cout << "world!"`.

**Key points to remember:**

- `operator<<` doesn't disappear after use; it holds onto the stream (conveyor belt) for chaining.
- The return value (like `std::cout`) isn't used for calculations, but for convenience in chaining.

Hopefully, this simpler analogy makes it easier to understand how these operators work together!

### C++ terms

**Operator Overloading and Side Effects**

In C++, operators can be overloaded, meaning we can define custom behavior for them when used with user-defined types. Here, we'll focus on two common operators:

- `operator=` (assignment operator): Used to assign a value to a variable.
- `operator<<` (insertion operator): Often used for outputting values to streams like the console.

While operators like `+` or `*` are primarily used for calculations and return the result, `operator=` and `operator<<` are used for their side effects. They modify variables or send data to a stream. However, they still return a value!

**The Importance of Return Values for Chaining**

The return value of these operators becomes crucial when we want to **chain** multiple operations on the same line. Here's how it works:

1. **Assignment Chaining:**

   ```c++
   int x = y = 5;  // Equivalent to x = (y = 5);
   ```
   - `y = 5` assigns 5 to `y`.
   - **Importantly**, `operator=` on `y` returns a reference to `y` itself. This allows the result (`y`) to be used in the next step, which is assigning it to `x`.

2. **Output Stream Chaining:**

   ```c++
   std::cout << "Hello " << "world!" << std::endl;
   ```
   - `operator<<` on `std::cout` (for the first string) doesn't just send "Hello " and vanish. It returns a reference to `std::cout` itself.
   - This allows further insertions (`"world!"` and `std::endl`) to be chained on the same stream (`std::cout`).

**Return Value Summary**

- `operator=`: Returns a reference to the left operand (e.g., `x` in `x = 5`). This allows chaining assignments.
- `operator<<` (output stream): Returns a reference to the output stream object (e.g., `std::cout` in `std::cout << "Hello"`). This allows chaining further output operations.

**Key Points**

- The return value of these operators is not used directly for calculations but enables chaining.
- The return value acts as a placeholder, allowing the result of one operation to be used in the next step of the chain.
