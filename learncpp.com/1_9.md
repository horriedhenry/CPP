[1.9 — Introduction to literals and operators](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-literals-and-operators/)

### Literals

Example

```c++
std::cout << "Hello world!";
int x { 5 };
```

A **literal** (also known as **literal constant**) is a fixed value that has been inserted directly into the source code.

#### Example

```c++
std::cout << 5 << "\n"; // 5 is a literal
```

```c++
int x { 5 };
std::cout << x << "\n";
```

Here 5 is a literal that will be copied to a memory location by the compiler so when ever we need 5 we access it through the variable **x** that is what we did with the **cout** statement.

### Key insight

Literals are values that are inserted directly into the source code. These values usually appear directly in the executable code (unless they are optimized out).

Objects and variables represent memory locations that hold values. These values can be fetched on demand.

### Operators (copy pasta)

The number of operands that an operator takes as input is called the operator’s **arity**. Operators in C++ come in four different **arities**.

1. **Unary** operators act on one operand. An example of a unary operator is the `-` operator. For example, given `-5`,  `operator-` takes literal operand `5` and flips its sign to produce new output value `-5`.
