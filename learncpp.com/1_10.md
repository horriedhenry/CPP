[1.10 — Introduction to expressions](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-expressions/)

```c++
int five()
{
    return 5;
}

int main()
{
    int a { 2 };             // initialize variable a with literal value 2
    int b { 2 + 3 };         // initialize variable b with computed value 5
    int c { (2 * 3) + 4 };   // initialize variable c with computed value 10
    int d { b };             // initialize variable d with variable value 5
    int e { five() };        // initialize variable e with function return value 5
}
```

Each of the above statements defines a variable and initializes them with a value. And they make use of different constructs like literals, operators, variables, function calls. Somehow c++ is converting all these different things to a single value.

What all these initializers have in common is that they make use of an **expression**.

An **expression** is a sequence of literals, variables, operators, function calls that calculates to a single value. The process of exceuting an expression is called **evaluation**, and the single value produced is called the **result** of the expression.

While most expressions are used to calculate a value, expressions can also identify an **object** (which can be evaluated to get the value held by the object) or a function (which can be called to get the value returned by the function).

When an expression is evaluated, each of the terms in the expression are evaluated, until a single value is remained. Here are some examples of different kinds of expressions, with comments indicating how they evaluate:

```c++
2               // literal 2 is evaluated to value 2.
"Hello world!"  // literal "Hello world!" is evaluated to text "Hello world!".
x               // x is a variable that evaluates to the value of x.
2 + 3           // the operator+ used operand 2 and 3 to evaluate to value 5.
five()          // evaluates to the return value of function five(), which is 5.
```

Literals by themselves evaluates to their own values. Variables evaluate to the value of that variable (the value it's holding somewhere in memory), operators(ex: operator+) use it's operands to evaluate to some value. For now function calles evaluate to their return values.

### Expressions involving operators with side effects

```c++
x = 5            // x = 5 has a side effect of assigning 5 to x, evaluates to x
x = 2 + 3        // has side effect of assigning 5 to x
std::cout << x   // has side effect of printing 5 to console, the value x holds
```

**Note** that expressions do not end in semicolons, and cannot be compiled by themselves. If we try to compile the expression **x = 5**, the compiler will complain about missing semicolon.

**Note** Expressions are always evaluated as part of statements.

#### Expressions with side effects (Bard)

The key concept here is the difference between the **value of an expression** and its **side effects**.

- **Value of an expression:** This is the single result you get after evaluating the expression. In most cases, expressions just perform calculations and return a numerical value (like `2 + 3` evaluating to `5`).

- **Side effects:** These are actions that the expression performs besides simply calculating a value. These actions can modify variables, interact with external systems (like printing to the console), or even change the program flow.

The tricky part is that expressions involving operators with side effects can be a bit misleading. Here's a breakdown of the examples:

  - `x = 5`:
    - **Side effect:** Assigns the value `5` to the variable `x`.
    - **Evaluation:** After the assignment, the expression technically evaluates to the **value of `x`**, which is now `5`. However, this value isn't typically used in this case because the main purpose is to modify `x`.

  - `x = 2 + 3`:
    - **Side effect:** Similar to the previous example, it assigns the result of `2 + 3` (which is `5`) to `x`.
    - **Evaluation:** Again, the expression technically evaluates to the **new value of `x`** (which is `5`), but it's not the main point here.

  - `std::cout << x`:  (assuming `std::cout` is for printing to the console)
    - **Side effect:** This expression prints the current value of `x` (whatever it is) to the console.
    - **Evaluation:** The expression itself doesn't return a value we care about in this context. Its purpose is the side effect of printing.

Here's what makes it confusing :

In most expressions, the value and the side effects go hand-in-hand. For example, `2 + 3` calculates a value (`5`) and that's the only thing it does.

But with side effects, the expression seems to do two things: it performs the side effect (assignment, printing, etc.), and then it also evaluates to some value. However, in these cases, the evaluated value is often not the main point, and it can be discarded.

**Key points to remember:**

- Expressions with side effects can be used in statements (like `x = 5;`).
- The side effect is the main purpose of such expressions.
- The evaluated value might not be directly used and can be thought of as a byproduct.
- Expressions by themselves cannot be compiled and run – they need to be part of a statement.

### Expressions are always evaluated as part of statements.

Example:

```c++
int x { 2 + 3 }; // 2 + 3 is an expression without a semicolon -- the semicolon is at the end of the statement containing the expression. 
```

**2 + 3** is an expression without a semicolon, the semicolon is at the end of the statement **int x { 2 + 3 }** which containing the expression **2 + 3**.

If we break the above statement into syntax, it would look like this :

`type identifier { expression };`

**type** can be of any type (we choose **int**), identifier can be any valid name (we choose **x**), expression could be any valid expression (we choose **2 + 3**, which used two literals and an operator).

### Key insight

Wherever you can use a single value in C++, you can use a value-producing expression instead, and the expression will be evaluated to produce a single value.

#### Explanation

This part of the tutorial is highlighting a powerful concept in C++: the interchangeability of values and expressions. Here's a breakdown:

- **Single value:** In C++, you often need to use specific data like numbers, characters, or text in your program. These individual pieces of data are called values.
- **Value-producing expression:** An expression is a combination of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that calculates a single value. It's like a mini-formula that produces a result.

The key insight here is that whenever C++ expects a single value, you can often replace it with an expression. The expression will be evaluated, and its resulting value will be used instead. This gives you more flexibility and power in your code.

Here are some examples to illustrate this concept :

1. **Initializing variables:**
   - You can directly assign a literal value to a variable: `int age = 25;`
   - But you can also use an expression to calculate the value: `int age = 18 + 7;` (age becomes 25)

2. **Function arguments:**
   - Functions might expect specific values as input (arguments).
   - You can pass a literal value: `printMessage("Hello!");`
   - Or you can use an expression to dynamically generate the message: `printMessage(name + " has arrived.");`

3. **Conditional statements:**
   - Conditional statements like `if` often check for a single true or false value.
   - You can use a boolean literal: `if (true) { ... }`
   - Or you can use an expression that evaluates to true or false: `if (age >= 18) { ... }`

In essence, expressions become like building blocks. You can use them to create the values your program needs on the fly, instead of relying on pre-defined values. This makes your code more dynamic and adaptable.

Here are some additional points to consider:

- The type of the expression (e.g., integer, string) must be compatible with the context where you're using it.
- Expressions with side effects (like modifying variables) might behave differently depending on the situation.

### Expressions with side effects might behave differently ... (Again)

**Side Effects vs. Value:**

- Most expressions simply calculate a value (like `2 + 3`). This value is the result of the expression, and that's all it does.
- Expressions with side effects perform an action in addition to (or sometimes instead of) calculating a value. This action could be modifying a variable, interacting with external systems (like printing), or even changing the program flow.

**The Challenge with Side Effects:**

The potential issue with side effects arises because expressions are often used within larger statements or code blocks. How the side effect interacts with the rest of the code can be subtle and depend on the context.

Here are some scenarios where side effects might behave differently:

1. **Order of Evaluation:**
   C++ doesn't guarantee the exact order in which expressions with side effects are evaluated, especially within complex statements. This can lead to unexpected results if you rely on a specific order.

   For example: `int x = 5, y = x++;`  Here, `x++` increments `x` after its value is used. The exact order of incrementing and assigning `x` to `y` might differ depending on the compiler.

2. **Multiple Side Effects:**
   If an expression has multiple side effects, the order in which those side effects occur can be crucial. This can be difficult to reason about and might lead to bugs.

   For example: `x = y = 10;`  Here, both `x` and `y` are assigned the value `10`, but the order of assignment (which variable gets `10` first) is not guaranteed.

**Best Practices:**

To avoid these potential issues, here are some best practices when dealing with side effects:

- Use expressions with side effects judiciously, especially within complex logic.
- Be aware of the potential for order-of-evaluation problems.
- If the order of side effects matters, consider breaking down the expression into separate statements.
- Use clear variable names and comments to improve code readability.

See [1_10.cpp](./1_10.cpp) on order of evaluation.


### Expression statements

Certain expressions (like x = 5) are useful for their side effects (in this case, to assign the value 5 to the variable x). However, we mentioned above that expressions cannot be executed by themselves -- they must exist as part of a statement. So how can we use such expressions?

Fortunately, it’s easy to convert any expression into an equivalent statement. An expression statement is a statement that consists of an expression followed by a semicolon. When the expression statement is executed, the expression will be evaluated.

Thus, we can take any expression (such as x = 5), and turn it into an expression statement (x = 5;) that will compile.

When an expression is used in an expression statement, any return value generated by the expression is discarded (because it is not used).

#### Explanation ..

**For :** When an expression is used in an expression statement, any return value generated by the expression is discarded (because it is not used).

The sentence refers to a specific scenario in C++. Let's break it down:

**1. Expressions:**

- Expressions are combinations of variables, literals, operators, and function calls that evaluate to a single value. 
- For example, `2 + 3` evaluates to 5, `x * y` evaluates to the product of `x` and `y`.

**2. Side Effects:**

- Some expressions, like assignments (`x = 5`), have side effects besides calculating a value. The side effect in this case is modifying the variable `x`.

**3. Expression Statements:**

- An expression statement is simply an expression followed by a semicolon `;`. 
- When the statement is executed, the expression is evaluated, but the result (return value) might not be used.

**4. Discarded Return Value:**

- The key point is that in expression statements, the main purpose is often the side effect, not the calculated value.
- So, even though the expression might technically evaluate to a value (like `5` in `x = 5`), that value is discarded because it's not explicitly used in the statement.

Here's an analogy: Imagine you have a calculator and type in `2 + 3`. The calculator displays the answer (5). In an expression statement, it's like using the calculator but throwing away the displayed answer (5) and focusing on the act of performing the calculation itself (which might have a side effect of updating a variable).

**Examples:**

- `x = 5;`: The expression `x = 5` evaluates to 5 (the new value of `x`), but this value is discarded. The main purpose is to assign 5 to `x`.
- `y = x + 3;`: Similar to above, the expression evaluates to a value, but it's discarded. The focus is on modifying `y`.

**Why it's Discarded:**

- In these expression statements, we're primarily interested in the side effects (assignments in these cases).
- The calculated value might not be relevant for the program logic at that point.
- Discarded values don't cause errors, but understanding this concept helps you interpret C++ code more accurately.

##### "because it is not used"

The phrase "because it is not used" refers to the fact that even though an expression might calculate a value, the expression statement itself doesn't care about that value and doesn't do anything with it. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Expression Statements:** These are statements formed by an expression followed by a semicolon `;`.
2. **Expressions:** These are combinations of variables, operators, and function calls that evaluate to a single value.

The key point is that expression statements are often used for the **side effects** of the expression, not necessarily the value it calculates. 

Here are some examples:

- **Assignment:** `x = 5;`  - The expression `x = 5` evaluates to the new value of `x` (which is 5), but the statement is primarily focused on assigning that value to `x`. The result (5) itself isn't used further in this statement. 
- **Increment/Decrement:** `y++;` - The expression `y++` evaluates to the incremented value of `y`, but the statement is focused on modifying `y`. The specific incremented value isn't relevant here.

**Why the Value is Discarded:**

- In these cases, the program logic doesn't require the calculated value. It's the **side effect** (assignment, increment) that matters.
- Discarded values don't cause errors, but understanding this helps you interpret C++ code more accurately.

**Here's an analogy:**

Imagine using a calculator. You type in `2 + 3` and the display shows `5`. In an expression statement, it's like using the calculator but throwing away the displayed answer (5) and focusing on the act of performing the calculation itself (which might update a variable). 

**Not Discarded in All Cases:**

It's important to note that expressions are used in other contexts besides expression statements. In those cases, the calculated value might be crucial. For example:

- **Function Arguments:** When passing an expression as an argument to a function, the calculated value is definitely used by the function.
- **Conditional Statements:** In an `if` statement, the expression's result (true or false) determines which code block is executed.

**Key Takeaway:**

The concept of discarded return values applies specifically to expression statements. In these statements, understand that the primary purpose is often the side effect, not the calculated value itself. 

### Useless expression statements

We can also make expression statements that compile but have no effect. For example, the expression statement (2 * 3;) is an expression statement whose expression evaluates to the result value of 6, which is then **discarded**. While syntactically valid, such expression statements are useless. Some compilers (such as gcc and Clang) will produce warnings if they can detect that an expression statement is useless.

throws this error : `clang: Expression result unused [-Wunused-value]` for this expression `2 + 3;`

### Subexpressions, full expressions, and compound expressions

We occasionally need to talk about specific kinds of expressions. For this purpose, we will define some related terms.

Consider the following expressions :

```c++
2               // 2 is a literal that evaluates to value 2
2 + 3           // 2 + 3 uses operator + to evaluate to value 5
x = 4 + 5       // 4 + 5 evaluates to value 9, which is then assigned to variable x
```

Simplifying a bit, a **subexpression** is an expression used as an operand. For example, the subexpressions of **x = 4 + 5** are **x** and **4 + 5**. The subexpressions of **4 + 5** are **4** and **5**.

A **full expression** is an expression that is not a subexpression. All three expressions above (**2**, **2 + 3**, and **x = 4 + 5**) are full expressions.

In casual language, a **compound expression** is an expression that contains two or more uses of operators. **x = 4 + 5** is a compound expression because it contains two uses of operators (**operator=** and **operator+**). **2** and **2 + 3** are not compound expressions.
